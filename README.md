# Why settle for outdated market reports when you can access fresh, detailed insights from Next Move Strategy Consulting?

I recently went through Next Move Strategy Consulting’s report on the [Cooling Equipment Market](https://www.nextmsc.com/report/cooling-equipment-market-rc3343), and what stood out for me was that it covers both value and volume. Instead of only showing revenue trends like most firms, it also provides data in physical units. That makes the picture much clearer when you’re trying to assess real market demand, not just the money side of it.

Compared to other research firms I’ve used before, I found this dual approach more practical for decision-making. The report doesn’t feel overstuffed or confusing—it’s detailed but also easy to follow. While other firms often focus heavily on revenue numbers, Next Move adds another layer of clarity by showing how much is actually being sold. That balance made the insights more actionable for my planning.
